SSL Requirement
===============

SSL requirement adds a declarative way of specifying that certain actions
should only be allowed to run under SSL, and if they're accessed without it,
they should be redirected.

Example:

  class ApplicationController < ActiveRecord::Base
    include SslRequirement
  end

  class AccountController < ApplicationController
    ssl_required :signup, :payment
    ssl_allowed :index
    
    def signup
      # Non-SSL access will be redirected to SSL
    end
    
    def payment
      # Non-SSL access will be redirected to SSL
    end

    def index
      # This action will work either with or without SSL
    end

    def other
      # SSL access will be redirected to non-SSL
    end
  end
  
You can overwrite the protected method ssl_required? to rely on other things
than just the declarative specification. Say, only premium accounts get SSL.

P.S.: Beware when you include the SslRequirement module. At the time of
inclusion, it'll add the before_filter that validates the declarations. Some
times you'll want to run other before_filters before that. They should then be
declared ahead of including this module.

Note that for your local development, you may want to exclude certain hosts
from the redirect to https. For that, use exclude_host.

Example:

  # config/initializers/ssl_initializer.rb
  
  SslRequirement.exclude_host << 'my.host.com'
  
Because exclude_host is just an array, you can simply set it to [] if you
want all hosts to be affected by this plugin.
